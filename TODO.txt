1. add the red squiggle logic
    - maybe introduce an alert whenever they type a word to be squiggled

2. make it so that there are no more red squiggles anymore


3. Maybe train an LLM and use that to introduce typos in code
    - or be good and try to fix code (boring)

4. Make it so that I do something crazy like edit the document to put weird comments in places. or delete all 'e's or something.
